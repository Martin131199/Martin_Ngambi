  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a research engineer specializing in renewable energy integration, energy efficiency, and decarbonization strategies. With a Master’s degree in Energy from Mines Paris-PSL and a Bachelor’s in Chemical Engineering from Tomsk State University, I have developed strong expertise in energy systems modeling, process optimization, and sustainability consulting.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have worked on carbon capture, biochar production, photovoltaic systems, and building energy efficiency, gaining hands-on experience with Aspen Plus, MATLAB, OpenModelica, and life cycle analysis. My experiences at Stellantis, CNRS, and Engie have strengthened my ability to approach complex energy challenges with a multidisciplinary and strategic mindset.

Beyond my technical expertise, I have also developed strong economic and strategic analysis skills, particularly in energy markets, carbon pricing, ESG risks and opportunities, and sustainable business models. I have earned certifications in Corporate Sustainability, Sustainability Consulting, Physical Chemistry, and ESG Risks & Opportunities, reinforcing my ability to bridge engineering solutions with economic and environmental strategies.

Passionate about sustainability and carbon neutrality, I aim to contribute to the decarbonization of industries and the optimization of energy systems through cutting-edge technologies, strategic consulting, and policy-driven approaches.</p>
